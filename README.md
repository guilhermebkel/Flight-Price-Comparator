# Flight Price Comparator

I've made this app in order to automatize the action of comparing flight prices all over the night (since there are no service that offers it) and plus, to automatically make a buying of a ticket when it its cheap enough.

## Dependencies
```npm install```

## Run
```
npm start # runs the local client
npm run test # runs the web scrap script
```
